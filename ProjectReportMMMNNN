4 choices:
- For the UserBase we decided to use a BALBOADLL as CardBox to connect each user to his/hers array of movie ratings. It
seemed the fastest data structure for both insertions and eventual lookups of the movie ratings.
We also considered to use a HashTable, but there were too many User objects with the same user_id, since each user rated
at least 20 movies, and we didn't know what function would have been efficient for an eventual casting of objects with
same keys. We needed a data structure as a BALBOADLL to make sure that same user ids were connected to the same data structure
containing movie ratings, so that the average for each genre could be calculated quickly.

- For the UserBase we decided to use a Map to relate each movie to its r_m average, so the lookup for each movie's r_m is
 fast (O(1)) when it's needed to calculate the preference factor.

- For the MovieBase we decided to use a map to make it for an easy lookup by key for the condensed list in genre. It made to code easily
readable and one line of code to find the genre of a movie.

- For the MovieBase having readMovies create an ArrayBuffer of all the Movies made it for a quick and easy way to add movies in and since we
knew the what the index was going to be as it was sorted by the movie id number, it was easy to search for the index
with the data given by u.data.
